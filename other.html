				<h2>Death</h2>
				<p>On the night of Thursday, September 20, 1973, during Croce's Life and Times tour and the day 
					before his ABC single "I Got a Name" was released, Croce and five others were killed when their 
					chartered Beechcraft E18S crashed into a tree during takeoff from the Natchitoches Regional Airport 
					in Natchitoches, Louisiana. Croce was 30 years old. Others killed in the crash were pilot Robert N. Elliott, 
					Croce's bandmate Maury Muehleisen, comedian George Stevens, manager and booking agent Kenneth D. Cortese, 
					and road manager Dennis Rast. An hour before the crash, Croce had completed a concert at 
					Northwestern State University's Prather Coliseum in Natchitoches; he was flying to Sherman, Texas, 
					for a concert at Austin College.
